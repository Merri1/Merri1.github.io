						<h2 class="text-uppercase">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2> <p>
							By downloading or using the game, these terms will
							automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
							that you read them carefully before using the game. You’re
							not allowed to copy, or modify the game, any part of the game,
							or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
							to extract the source code of the game, and you also
							shouldn’t try to translate the game into other languages, or
							make derivative versions. The game itself, and all the trade
							marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
							property rights related to it, still belong to
							Merri Mogridge.
						  </p> <p>
							The Ouster Swarm game stores and processes personal data
							that you have provided to us, in order to provide
							my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
							phone and access to the game secure. We therefore recommend
							that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
							process of removing software restrictions and limitations
							imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
							could make your phone vulnerable to
							malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
							security features and it could mean that the
							Ouster Swarm game won’t work properly or at all.
						  </p> <p>
							You should be aware that there are certain things that
							Merri Mogridge will not take responsibility for.
							Certain functions of the game will require the game to have an
							active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
							provided by your mobile network provider, but
							Merri Mogridge cannot take responsibility for the
							game not working at full functionality if you don’t have
							access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
							allowance left.
						  </p> <p></p> <p>
							If you’re using the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
							should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
							mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
							may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
							for the duration of the connection while accessing the game,
							or other third party charges. In using the game, you’re
							accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
							roaming data charges if you use the game outside of your home
							territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
							roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
							which you’re using the game, please be aware that we assume
							that you have received permission from the bill payer for
							using the game.
						  </p> <p>
							Along the same lines, Merri Mogridge cannot always
							take responsibility for the way you use the game i.e. You
							need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
							runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
							Service, Merri Mogridge cannot accept
							responsibility.
						  </p> <p>
							With respect to Merri Mogridge’s responsibility for
							your use of the game, when you’re using the game, it’s
							important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
							ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
							rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
							we can make it available to you.
							Merri Mogridge accepts no liability for any loss,
							direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
							wholly on this functionality of the game.
						  </p> <p>
							At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is
							currently available on Android – the requirements for
							system (and for any additional systems we
							decide to extend the availability of the game to) may change,
							and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
							playing the game. Merri Mogridge does not promise that
							it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you
							and/or works with the Android version that you have
							installed on your device. However, you promise to always
							accept updates to the game when offered to you, We
							may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate
							use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
							to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
							(a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
							will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed)
							delete it from your device.
						  </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
							I may update our Terms and Conditions
							from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
							periodically for any changes. I will
							notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
							Conditions on this page. These changes are effective
							immediately after they are posted on this page.
